					Lockouts are head-to-head programming contests where two competitors race each other to
					solve problems. Contestants can solve the problems in any order and only the first person
					to solve a problem gets the points, creating an exciting game of speed and strategy. We
					host this every month and have previously organized contests against other schools!

					We hold hybrid bi-weekly mock contests similar to ICPC with problems from a variety of
					sources such as Kattis and Codeforces as well as problems submitted by club members. The
					contest is 2.5 hours long, and the last half hour of the meeting reserved for solution
					discussion.
